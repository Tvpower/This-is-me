# Day 1: And it was all silent

Yet another day goes by. Silent in the night, lost everything again. 

I have never understood this feeling and how I let it pass every time it happens to me. Perhaps it is my age and that child that once had enough dreams and energy has faded away.
Perhaps I don't fully understand myself, and that's why I keep catching my own tail every time and realize the time I waste sometimes.

Every opportunity in my table yet I don't understand how to take advantage of it. Another hour, minute, and second goes by. I want to do more, I want to achieve the words I so much speak.
But every time I try, I can't seem to understand what goes wrong with me. 

Es un lamento profundo!

I'll try tomorrow again and tell myself how important this is for me perhaps the person that feels like fading away will once again wake up and give back his dreams.
But what if it doesn't work? Then I'll just try to wake him up again because I feel dead from time to time.

Of all the people in this world, I was given the chance to achieve something great, but I haven't and I want to.
So I'll make tomorrow better and make sure not to rest till I do.

## What This Is

A book of the past:
- Collecting the thoughts I want to get rid of.
- An opportunity to make something better.
- A cue into what's wrong with me.
- The fucks up I repetitively do. 

## Why Now?

Because the noise in my head needed an outlet. If I don't act now, my head will be rotten, and I'll just fade away once more, and I will lose it all again.

*"The cave you fear entering holds the treasure you seek."* - Thanks J.C.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow:
- Avoid the book's mistakes
- Force the system to work. No matter what
- A wish to win and achieve
- Walk to the goal with no remorse
- Create who I want to be rather than let it fade away.

*A first step, a wish for being better.*
