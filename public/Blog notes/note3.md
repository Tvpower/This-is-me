# Day 3: I thought to myself, but who am I? 

You know whats weird of the constant pain of feeling trapped?

Is that whenever I look into what's missing I never find the answer. Destiny keep us on a infinite loop:
Trying new things, working on stuff but truly is that enough? Have I ever done enough?

And I say to myself what if I do this? what if I do that? I never do I just stay thinking not knowing if the path im abt
to take is truly worth it.

but why?

Why not just do something? why not put my brain to think to achieve the person who I want to be.

Is it because I dont have somebody to talk to. Does everybody think im annoying? what does that part of myself makes
people abandon me and leave?

why do they ignore me?


## What This Is

The thoughts trapped in my brain.
-The person I want to be but dont know how to get

## Why Now?

Because I need to un-slave myself from my own head.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow:
- Will there ever be a tomorrow to hope for?
