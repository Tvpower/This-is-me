# Day 4: Do I share the belief that I will once grow up? 

Is it ok to be different?

Do we all think that we will be ever part of a group of people?
people that believe in me the way I sometimes think of myself. It hurts to sometimes be so alone and think that every person I talked to find me horribly annoying.

I want to be different one day but I dont know how. It excites me to think that I will be part of a 1% that I could belong within a group of people so special everybody wants to be like them.
I mean I know how but I always ignore the part on how to make it happen. I always take the easy route. Nobody trusts me.

It feels like I cant never stopped being a loser but is that true?


## What This Is

A 2am talked that woke me up and I know I can't  ignore it.

## Why Now?

I want to feel needed by someone besides those who love me.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow:
- Will be today
