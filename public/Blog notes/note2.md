# Day 2: Wake up every day feeling like I will never do enough

It's hard to worry about myself. Every day I wake up feeling "Oh yeah Ill do it different." "I'll be a better different person today"

But some part of me is still trying to be a lazy. And tbh I think I need to blame myself more it might be the ADHD or something like that but yk...

I also like to hate a lot. I hate how people see life as such a generic thing and people try to be like the others. 
I hate trends and the repetitive things some industries make. I hate how they ruin shows I like by trying to juice every single peenny out of them.
And I see people often fall for the same tricks. I wish I could say something, but then I'm the bad guy.

But anyways I need to concentrate on doing better for myself rather than hating.
I like to hate sometimes I think its funny maybe thats why I check the people on r*@$&i43 and make fun of them LOL...


## What This Is

A window:
- Into who i am?
- Is this real?
- Will this help?

## Why Now?

Because I made my head to always think in a negative way about everything.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow:
- Decide
- Do
- Create
- Hate (LOL)
